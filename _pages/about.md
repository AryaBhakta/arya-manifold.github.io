# An Interdisciplinary Approach to Economics

Welcome. I am an undergraduate student pursuing a dual degree in Economics, with minors in Mathematics and Statistics, and Data Science & Machine Learning. My academic journey is driven by a deep curiosity for the complex patterns that govern our world, and a conviction that the most profound insights are found at the intersections of different fields.

My primary interest lies in applying advanced, quantitative frameworks from mathematics, computer science, and even theoretical physics to better understand economic and financial systems. I am fascinated by the idea of moving beyond traditional economic models to explore concepts from statistical mechanics, complexity science, and quantum theory. These fields offer a powerful lens through which we can view economies not as static systems in equilibrium, but as dynamic, evolving structures shaped by the intricate interactions of countless agents.

This theoretical interest fuels the projects I am eager to pursue. I am particularly drawn to the emerging field of Heterodox Economics, which may include emerging topics like COmplexity Economics, Quantum Economics etc. Through simulations and advanced data visualizations, the website would aim to make cutting-edge economic theories more accessible and intuitive for students and researchers alike.

My dual degree provides the essential toolkit for this pursuit. I am passionate about leveraging computational methods, from machine learning algorithms to data visualization in Python, to build, test, and communicate new economic frameworks.

This website will serve as a living document of my academic journey. Here, I will share my projects, research, and explorations as I continue to seek out the connections between seemingly disparate fields to forge a more nuanced understanding of our economic world.
